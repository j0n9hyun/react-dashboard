We reverse engineered this small, yet complex, malware that is portable to many operating systems including Linux, BSD, Solaris, and possibly AIX and Windows. We have named this malware Kobalos for its tiny code size and many tricks; in Greek mythology, a Kobalos is a small, mischievous creature. Today we publish a paper titled \"A wild Kobalos appears: Tricksy Linux malware goes after HPCs\" describing the inner working of this threat."

CrimsonIAS is notable as it listens for incoming connections only; making it different from typical Windows backdoors that beacons out. The characteristics found in CrimsonIAS’s execution flow suggest a connection to Mustang Panda (aka BRONZE PRESIDENT, RedDelta) PlugX samples.  Based on those non-unique characteristics, ThreatConnect assesses with low confidence that CrimsonIAS is an additional tool in Mustang Panda’s repertoire.  Industry reporting assesses with varying levels of confidence that Mustang Panda is a Chinese espionage actor that has conducted operations in Mongolia, Vietnam, and Hong Kong among other locations.  According to fellow researchers, Mustang Panda targets non-government organizations (NGOs), law enforcement organizations, and political entities."

Raindrop is very similar to the already documented Teardrop tool, but there are some key differences between the two. While Teardrop was delivered by the initial Sunburst backdoor (Backdoor.Sunburst), Raindrop appears to have been used for spreading across the victim’s network. Symantec has seen no evidence to date of Raindrop being delivered directly by Sunburst. Instead, it appears elsewhere on networks where at least one computer has already been compromised by Sunburst."

TrendMicro also learned that the main code components of this campaign is written in AHK. By tracking the campaign components, we found out that its activity has been occurring since early 2020. The malware infection consists of multiple stages that start with a malicious Excel file. In turn, this file contains an AHK script compiler executable, a malicious AHK script file, and a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) AutoOpen macro. The full attack chain is depicted in Figure 1. Our telemetry tracked the malware’s command-and-control (C&C) servers and determined that these come from the US, the Netherlands, and Sweden. We also learned that the malware has been targeting financial institutions in the US and Canada."
